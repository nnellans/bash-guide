> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an advanced guide and assumes you already know the basics of Bash.  Think of this more like an advanced cheat sheet.  I went through various sources, captured any notes that I felt were important, and organized them into the README file you see here.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a live document.  Some of the sections are still a work in progress.  I will be continually updating it over time.
